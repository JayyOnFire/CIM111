        <p>I grew up in Bronx, NY but I have lived in South Carolina since attending high school. There is where I gained my love for basketball and soccer. I played all four years of high school. I have always enjoyed being apart of the team, but as I grew I wanted to connect with the sports on a different level and being a sports broadcaster could be the right answer. </p>
